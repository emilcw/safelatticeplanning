### Configuration file for the experiments to be run in the motion planning scenarios.

#### If you want to run scenarios, recommened setup is ####
# motion_planners - Your choice
# tests - live
# scenarios - the ones you want to test
# world - test
# mode - static

#### If you don't want to run a scenario ####
# Currently you need to specify a scenario in order to use the motion planners
# since the lattice planner will not plan until it has a valid_scenario.

# Will make the simulation sleep 10000 seconds after finishing
debug: False

# Set maximum simulation time in seconds
max_time: 900

# Set the number of simulations runs in a certain scenario for a certain motion planner
simulation_runs: 1

# Set DJI100 Safety radius in meters
dji_safety_radius: 1.0
# Note: Dynamic obstacle safety radius is set in Scenario.cpp
# NOTE: If too big, will the dji not be able to complete
# certain scenarios since the passages simply are too narrow

# Select preferred location tolerance for each planner
